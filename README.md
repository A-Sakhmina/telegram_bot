## Telegram bot @JavaSpringDemoBot

Creating Telegram(through extending `TelegramLongPollingBot`) bot using:
- Spring Boot
- JPA(JpaRepository for Users)
- PostgreSQL database
- Maven
- Lombok(for logging )

At the moment bot has its Menu with commands, 
saves user's data into database after getting command `/start`.

In the future **it will be upgraded** by:
- deploying into remote server;
- having its own functional(wish list);
- etc.
